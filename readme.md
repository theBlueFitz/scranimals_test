# Project Summary

This is my final group project created during my time at Northcoders, we were challenged to create an online application using a minimum of two new tech stacks. We were set up in our groups and taught to work in an 'agile' working environment using best industry practices in order to complete the project.

My group decided to build a food diary/tamagotchi style mobile only application using react-native and expo go for the front end and Google firebase for the back-end server side of the project. This was after Vue.js and MongoDB were spiked and ruled out for being less applicable to the kind of product we wanted to create.

The key sections that I was personally responsible for was setting up the database and ensuring that all connections and functions were working correctly, spiking and teaching other team mates how to utilise react-native to it's maximum capabilities as well as expo go and helping to design and implement the water and step tracker as well as implementing expo notification in order to enable push notifications (currently only able to send manually).

React-native was chosen as we wanted to create an application that was accessible to both android and apple users.
